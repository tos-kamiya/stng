# stng

stng, a sentence-transformer-based natural-language grep.

The `stng` is an off-the-shelf grep-like tool that performs semantic similarity search.
With Sentence Transformer models, search document files that contain similar parts to query.
Supports searching within text files (.txt), PDF files (.pdf), and MS Word files (.docx).

It is recommended to run this tool on a PC equipped with a GPU, as it performs calculations with PyTorch.

**⚠️ ITS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL.**
